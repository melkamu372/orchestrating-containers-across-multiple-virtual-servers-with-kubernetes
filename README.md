ðŸ’¡ Background: In [previous project](https://github.com/melkamu372/Migration-to-the-cloud-with-containerization), I worked on containerization with Docker, learning how to prepare and deploy containers using Docker Compose. This time, I took things a step further by moving into container orchestration using Kubernetes (K8s)â€”the industry-standard tool for managing production-scale deployments.

ðŸ”¨ Project Overview:

- Title: Orchestrating containers across multiple virtual servers with kubernetes
 From-Ground-Up
- Objective: Build a Kubernetes cluster from scratch to deeply understand its components and architecture.

ðŸ“‹ What I Accomplished:

- Set up 3 EC2 instances using AWS (1 Kubernetes Master, 2 Worker Nodes)
- Configured SSL/TLS certificates to ensure secure communication between Kubernetes components
- Built and configured the Node Network and Pod Network for efficient container communication
- Deployed Kubernetes tools like kubectl, Docker Engine, and security utilities like cfssl and cfssljson

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:

- VM: AWS EC2
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Kubernetes Cluster
- Docker Engine & kubectl

This hands-on project helped me master Kubernetes cluster creation and management, deepening my understanding of container orchestration in real-world scenarios.
